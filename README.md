# Dual-Converter-RC-Submarine-Propulsion-System
Designed dual-converter system (Flyback+Boost) for RC submarine propulsion in MATLAB. Flyback enabled 15% faster acceleration; Boost provided stable maneuvering (Â±0.1V ripple). Achieved 20% higher efficiency than single-converter designs. Demonstrates optimized power delivery through calculated component selection and closed-loop control.
